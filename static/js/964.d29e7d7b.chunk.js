I am completing my Honours in Computer Science with Cyber & Internet Security this Spring 2023, and constantly looking to improve my development skills and myself as a whole. I can't wait to get started on new projects as well as continue helping open-source projects online to expand my portfolio of skills & technical knowledge.\r\n\r\n# Currently\r\n\r\nAt CIMS, I have learned how to connect with multi-disciplinary teams, network with people, interact in the open-source community, and build prototypes fully equipped with design with technologies like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), and [Auth0](https://auth0.github.io/express-openid-connect/).
